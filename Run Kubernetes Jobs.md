# Run Kuberetes Jobs on the PRP

Kubernetes Jobs and Pods hold a higher similarity. Jobs are a higher abstraction than pod; you can have multiple pods in job. A job will make sure the task is completed in case a pod fails (similar to how a computer just sometimes crashes and you have to restart it). Jobs take care of the grunt work of making sure pods are doing what they are suppose to be doing. 

Jobs are vital when you are running large complicated data processes.
