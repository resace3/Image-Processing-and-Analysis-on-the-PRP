# Getting Started With the PRP

Sign in with your Caltech credentials at https://nautilus.optiputer.net/ , and as an admin, I can approve you to start using the free computing power offered to researchers.

Once you have your config file, you can place should place it in a .kube folder in your home direcotry ( ~/.kube/config ). 
Windows: C:\Users\Nick Rezaee\.kube\config
Mac: /Users/Nick Rezaee/.kube/config

Once you have the config file in the right folder, you can start running scripts on the PRP via Kubernetes.

In order to run your script, you will need to put it in a docker container, which will run inside a Kubernetes pods.
